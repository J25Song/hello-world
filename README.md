# hello-world
new beginning of programming
beginner trying to learn using codes to handle data, make it visualized beautifually and make parametric design.
firstly, take the python for data processing;
then know more about coding to do data vidualization;
later on, start a real parametric design, espacially something relating to biological simulation.
the first problem I ganna meet is the time management and existing bad execution habit; 
the second one is my chaotic modes of thinking and degenerating thinking ability.
but I MUST OVERCOME and RETRAIN my thinking ability and learn new more various modes of thinking;
that one of the most imprtant reason why I want to code.
finally， new journey begins！
